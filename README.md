# Atmega328p w/Arduino bootloader RGB LCD

This Project hosts the code for my project to make an LCD screen that will be controlled by the Atmega328p with the Arduino bootloader on it. I will be using various tutorials and guides and will provide the link to all of them in the sources Section below.

Essentially, this is a collection of all the resources you'll need to get the microcontroller to continually send and change messages on an LCD screen. I recommend soldering components to a protobroad and providing plugs for the pins when you want to reflash the code with new messages.
